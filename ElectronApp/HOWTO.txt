4) run "./ModelSys/python/bin/python.exe -m pip install --no-warn-script-location -U pip" under this directory as working directory
5) run "./ModelSys/python/bin/python.exe -m pip install --no-warn-script-location onnxruntime tensorflow numpy==1.24.3 scikit-learn==1.3.0 joblib" under this directory as working directory
>> if not work then delete the python directory then redo from 3) again but for this... used this
>> $: ./ModelSys/python/bin/python.exe -m pip install --no-warn-script-location onnxruntime==1.19.2 tensorflow==2.17.1 numpy==1.24.3 scikit-learn==1.3.0 joblib==1.4.2
